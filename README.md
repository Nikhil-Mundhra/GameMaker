Initial Idea & Game Play
The gameâ€™s mission is to educate players on responsible energy consumption, a crucial element in understanding urban sustainability and sustainable living environments.
The game is set when the world is on the brink of complete irreversible climate change that could destroy life as we know it. However, humans are still greedy and wish to enjoy utilities and achieve happiness. 
The objective is to prevent death by climate change while maintaining a sustainable carbon footprint till happiness reaches 100%. The player must turn on many utilities and maintain plants to end the game quicker or wait a long time with fewer utilities.
Additionally, to prevent players from just waiting for happiness to reach 100%, the sustainable carbon footprint limit is reduced throughout the game, making victory difficult as time passes. 
Game Play
Environment: Urban home (1-floor circular apartment), multiple rooms
View: Top View (2D like AmongUs)
Movement & Controls: Users can roam in 2D, and interact with objects(Utilities/Plants).
Happiness bar: Starts at 40% by default and depletes at 2% per second
Energy Points: Each point increases the happiness bar by 0.5% per sec
Carbon Footprint: Energy points increase carbon footprint while maintaining plants decreases it. The quota for carbon footprint slowly depletes as the game progresses.
Climate change ghost: A high carbon footprint triggers the relentless ghost that follows the user until all utilities are switched off. Touching the ghost results in death, and the ghost being active depletes happiness at 4% per second. 
Win Condition: Either turn all utilities on while keeping a low carbon footprint or wait till the happiness bar gets to 100%. 

Bullet points:
- Focus of the game: urban sustainability and mainly on sustainable living
- Mission: educate players responsible energy consumption 
- Pre-story: We place player into future with consequences of climate change that requires smart energy management

Additional Ideas:
Energy Quota: Slowly depletes as the game progresses
Potential Name of the Game: Smog Life 
Our game can have this following issue: while the carbon limit will decrease the user fill try to maximize his/her energy consumption within the carbon limit by switching off low power devices and trading them with devices of higher energy consumption (I guess the level of happiness will be connected to the energy consumption level of the device) ?  - the same issue will be if we remove quota and just do decreasing Hp
